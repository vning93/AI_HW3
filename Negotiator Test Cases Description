Test Cases:

1) If offer’s utility to me is above a threshold then, we accept. This threshold decreases over time. Strategy to proposing a counteroffer is same as BANegotiator
	Threshold …
	a. linearly decreases
	b. asymptotically decreases (y = 1 / x)
	c. alternates at half max_iterations: linear then, exponential (mean, then nice)
	d. alternates depending on how slowly opponent is giving in (flexible nice-ness or mean-ness)

2) Always returns preferences as return offer (really mean).

3) Randomly switches 2 items from their offer and returns as new offer (variation of random). Uses (1d) approach to accepting offer.
