\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Test Cases:\
\

\b0 1) If offer\'92s utility to me is above a threshold then, we accept. This threshold decreases over time. Strategy to proposing a counteroffer is same as BANegotiator\
	Threshold \'85\
	a. linearly decreases\
	b. asymptotically decreases (y = 1 / x)\
	c. alternates at half max_iterations: linear then, exponential (mean, then nice)\
	d. alternates depending on how slowly opponent is giving in (flexible nice-ness or mean-ness)\
\
2) Always returns preferences as return offer (really mean).\
\
3) Randomly switches 2 items from their offer and returns as new offer (variation of random). Uses (1d) approach to accepting offer.\
